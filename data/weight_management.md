# Weight Management (brief, behavior‑forward)

- **Energy balance**: weight change occurs when intake and expenditure differ over time. Sustainable approaches focus on food quality, portions, and habits.
- **Satiety strategies**: prioritize protein, fiber, and minimally processed foods; manage liquid calories; regular meal timing works for many.
- **Portions & environment**: use smaller plates, plan meals, keep nutrient‑dense snacks visible.
- **Sleep & stress**: both influence appetite and food choices.
