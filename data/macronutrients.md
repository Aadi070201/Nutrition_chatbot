# Macronutrients

## Overview
- **Carbohydrates**: primary energy; fiber supports GI health, glycemic control, and satiety.
- **Fats**: energy-dense; cell membranes; fat-soluble vitamin absorption; essential fatty acids (omega‑3, omega‑6).
- **Proteins**: amino acids for tissue maintenance, enzymes, hormones; essential amino acids must come from diet.
- **Alcohol**: energy (7 kcal/g) without essential nutrients; health risks increase with intake.

### Typical Intake Ranges (adults)
- **Carbohydrates**: 45–65% of total energy (emphasize whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables).
- **Fat**: 20–35% of total energy (focus on unsaturated; limit saturated; avoid industrial trans fat).
- **Protein**: 10–35% of total energy (~0.8 g/kg/day baseline; higher for athletes/older adults).

## Fiber
- Aim for ~**25–38 g/day** (women/men). Benefits: stool regularity, LDL‑C reduction (soluble fiber), improved satiety.
- Sources: legumes, oats, barley, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains.

## Added Sugars
- Limit to **<10%** of energy (ideally lower). Prefer unsweetened foods/drinks.
