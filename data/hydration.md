# Hydration & Electrolytes

- Fluid needs vary with body size, activity, climate. A simple guide is to drink to thirst and aim for paleâ€‘yellow urine.
- During prolonged intense exercise or heat, include fluids with sodium and carbohydrates.
- Alcohol and very high caffeine intakes can increase diuresis; account for this in hydration planning.
