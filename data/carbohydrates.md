# Carbohydrates

## Types
- **Simple** (mono-/disaccharides): rapidly digested; many sweetened foods.
- **Complex** (starches & fiber): slower digestion; higher satiety.
- **Fiber**: soluble (oats, legumes, fruit) and insoluble (whole grains, bran, veg). Prebiotic fibers support microbiome.

## Glycemic Index/Load
- Low‑GI foods (legumes, intact whole grains) may help glycemic control; total diet pattern and fiber matter more than GI alone.

## Whole Grains
- Choose intact or minimally processed grains (oats, barley, brown rice, quinoa).
