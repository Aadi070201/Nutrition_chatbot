# Dietary Fats

## Types
- **Saturated fat (SFA)**: solid at room temp; typically raise LDL‑C. Main sources: fatty meats, full‑fat dairy, tropical oils.
- **Monounsaturated fat (MUFA)**: olive oil, canola, avocados, nuts; associated with favorable cardiometabolic profiles.
- **Polyunsaturated fat (PUFA)**: 
  - **Omega‑3 (ALA, EPA, DHA)**: anti‑inflammatory roles; cardiovascular & neurocognitive benefits. Sources: fatty fish, flax, chia, walnuts.
  - **Omega‑6 (LA, AA)**: essential; found in many plant oils, nuts, seeds.
- **Trans fat**: industrial PHOs should be **0**; naturally occurring ruminant trans fats are small and not typically a concern at usual intakes.

## Practical Targets
- Keep **SFA <10%** of energy; lower to **~5–6%** if you need to reduce LDL‑C.
- Prefer **MUFA/PUFA** in place of SFA and refined carbs.
- Include **2 servings/week of fatty fish** for EPA/DHA (or discuss supplements if intake is low).

## Food Sources (quick map)
- MUFA: olive oil, avocado, almonds, peanuts.
- PUFA: salmon, sardines, mackerel; walnuts, flax, chia; soy/ sunflower oils.
- SFA: butter, lard, high‑fat cheeses, cream, coconut/palm oils.
- Trans: avoid foods with **“partially hydrogenated oils.”**
